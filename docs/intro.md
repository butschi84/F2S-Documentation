# install crds
kubectl apply -f https://butschi84.github.io/F2S/helm-release/crds/crds.yaml

# install f2s
helm install f2s f2s/f2s
```

## Core Concept

* Keep it as simple as can be
* Run out of the box with as few dependencies as possible. <br/>
  No service meshes or other dependencies
* Simple start. Up and running in default config in 1 minute
* Lightweight. Use the features of vanilla kubernetes where ever possible
* Intuitive. No steep learning curve<br/>
  Beginners can use a UI to manage the soultion (i.e. create the CRDâ€™s using the UI)
* No "enterprise only" features
